\title{An interactive histogram plot with mean and median}
\usage{
plot_heart(
  data,
  type = c("hist", "density", "scatter", "boxplot", "correlation"),
  var_x = NULL,
  var_y = NULL
)

plot_heart(
  data,
  type = c("hist", "density", "scatter", "boxplot", "correlation"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the variable to be plotted.}

\item{type}{indicate which type of plot to generate. Options are:
\describe{
  \item{"hist"}{Histogram with density overlay for a numeric predictor.}
  \item{"density"}{Density plot for a numeric predictor.}
  \item{"scatter"}{Scatter plot of a numeric predictor vs the response variable.}
  \item{"boxplot"}{Boxplot of a categorical predictor vs the response variable.}
  \item{"correlation"}{Correlation matrix heatmap for all numeric predictors.}
}}

\item{var_x}{represent the character string that specify variable to plot on the x-axis.
is required for "hist", "density", "scatter", and "boxplot" types.}

\item{var_y}{Optional character string that specify variable to plot on the y-axis.
if not inputed, the response variable is used by default}

\item{var}{A character string that gives the name of the numeric variable to
plot}

\item{heart_dat}{is the dataset.}
}
\value{
An interactive histogram produced by \code{plotly::ggplotly()}

A ggplot object showing the requested visualization.
}
\description{
This function create a histogram based on the selected variable from the data
frame. The vertical lines shows the mean and the median, and the plot is
converted to an interactive plot using \pkg{plotly}.
}
\details{
This function is designed to help explore which predictors have an impact heart disease.
- For numeric predictors, you can visualize distributions, density, and relationship with heart disease.
- For categorical predictors, you can see differences in heart disease rates across groups.
- The correlation matrix helps identify relationships between numeric predictors.
(1 = highest, 0 = lowest)

data("heart_dat")
heart <- heart_dat
plot_heart(heart, "hist", var_x = "BMI")
plot_heart(heart, "boxplot", var_x = "Age", var_y = "Heart_Disease")
plot_heart(heart, "correlation")
